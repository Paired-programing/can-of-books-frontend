## Overview
Can Of Books is a react application consisting of a front end and back end, the front end of which allows a visitor to save a list of books to a carousel REACTJS component, which is saved via a backend call using Mongoose to save the information provided to an Atlas MongoDB database.

## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->
Visit the main page at https://can-of-books-casey-yurii.netlify.app/ to get started saving your favorite books!

## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->
This application is in three parts. The frontend and backend are hosted on Github, with the front end being created in REACTJS, and the backend being created in javascript, using Axios and Mongoose for data transfer between the front and back end, and the NoSQL Database hosted at Atlas. Data handed in from the user in front end is passed to the back end, which is then socketed into a database so the user's book preferences and status can be saved.

## Change Log
<!-- Use this area to document the iterative changes made to your application as each feature is successfully implemented. Use time stamps. Here's an example:

01-01-2001 4:59pm - Application now has a fully-functional express server, with a GET route for the location resource. -->
02-11-2023 1:50PM - Front end, back end, and database server established, github organization established, and templates implemented for front and back ends.

## Estimates

## Credit and Collaborations
<!-- Give credit (and a link) to other people or resources that helped you build this application. -->
Yurii Hlukhyi and Casey Glidewell of Code Fellows collaborated on making this application, with Casey serving as driver for the backend and navigator for the front, with Yurii serving as driver for the front end, and navigator for the back.

The instructional lead of Code Fellows' Roger Reyes is the only reason this project exists. Thank you.
